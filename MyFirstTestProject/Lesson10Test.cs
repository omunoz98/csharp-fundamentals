             Write a test method inside the Lesson10Test.cs file. 
            Ensure you have the [TestMethod] above this method. This method will be called IdVerify.
            We will be utilizing the arrange and assert portions of the AAA pattern.
            Create a variable of int called id. Provide a value for this variable. 
            Create an object of Lesson 10 using the default constructor. 
            Using the object created, assign the id variable to the Id property
            Using an Assert, we are going to check to see if theid property was assigned properly,
            or if its still using the default value of 1000. Pick through the Assert methods to determine which would fit. 
            There are more than 1 possible method to test this, including the one used in the lecture.
            Run the test several times to ensure you get both a passing test and a failure. 
            Ensure you provide a passing version in your checked in code.You only need to provide 1 Assert + method
